# Welcome to my GitHub profile!
## About me:
- 👋 Hi, I’m @koinoyokanuwu, but you can call me Jesica. 
- 👀 I’m interested in programming languages and software development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Software Analysis and Development at SENA
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every stage of software development, specially in front end.


## Why am I here now?
I studied a technical carrer in accounting, but now, after three years dedicated to being an assistant and being envolved in lots of accounting softwares, I decided to start at software development... It isn't as simple as it sounds, but now we're here and we're learning on the go.
Of course I don't have experience in software development, but I'm more than motivated to start from zero.
